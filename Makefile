# NAME
#     _output.banner - Display a prominent banner.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     make TARGET_NAME=CALlING_TARGET _output.banner
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     This is really just meant for internal use. Since I'm colourblind, visual
#     markers help a lot especially when viewing a ton of output in a CI tool
#     like Jenkins or TravisCI, for example.
#
#     This displays a prominent banner and is totally customizable.
#     The banner consists of a string of characters, $(BANNER_CHAR), on the first
#     line, the next line starts with a prefix, $(BANNER_PREFIX), followed by
#     $(TARGET_NAME). The next line is the final one and it's identical to the
#     first. The length is determined baseed on the length of $(BANNER_PREFIX)
#     and $(TARGET_NAME), which is a required argument.
#
#     TARGET_NAME
#         The name of the target for which the banner will be displayed.
#         The variable passed in is usually '$@'.' This argument is required.
#
#     BANNER_PREFIX
#         The prefix text in the banner which appears just before and on the
#         same line as $(TARGET_NAME).
#
#     BANNER_CHAR
#         The character for the banner which will form a line above and below
#         $(TARGET_NAME).
#
# EXAMPLES
#     make TARGET_NAME=$@ _output.banner
#         Displays a banner for the target '$(TARGET_NAME)':
#
#             $ make TARGET_NAME="foobar" _output.banner
#             ##############
#             TARGET: foobar
#             ##############
#
#     make BANNER_CHAR="-" BANNER_PREFIX="> " TARGET_NAME=$@ _output.banner
#         Displays a banner with hyphens at the top and bottom and a prefix
#         of "> ":
#             $ make BANNER_CHAR="-" BANNER_PREFIX="> " TARGET_NAME=foobar _output.banner
#             --------
#             > foobar

# NAME
#     help - Display callable targets as well as manuals for individual targets using HELP_TARGET.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     make [OPTION]... help
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Displays all the callable targets in this Makefile. If HELP_TARGET is
#     given, the documentation above the target (like this one you're reading
#     right now) for that corresponding target, HELP_TARGET, is displayed.
#
#     This is a pure Bash implementation without the use of cat, grep, sed,
#     awk, etc...well, what do you expect, this IS Sheldon!
#
#     HELP_TARGET
#         The target to to display the documentation for.
#
# EXAMPLES
#     make help
#         Displays all callable targets.
#
#     make HELP_TARGET=check.lint.shellcheck help
#         Displays the documentation for the 'shellcheck' target.
